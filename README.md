**Social Media Insights for Udemy Success**
Explore the connection between LinkedIn and YouTube activity and Udemy success through these visualizations. Data sourced by web scraping was cleaned, analyzed and uploaded to an AWS Athena database (link may be updated) which was linked to Tableau.

  **Udemy & LinkedIn Dashboard:**
No clear link was found between Udemy success and regular LinkedIn activity. The only moderate correlation is between LinkedIn followers and Udemy students.

  **Udemy & YouTube Dynamics:**
The Udemy and YouTube story on the other hand, has quite the patterns to uncover;

1.	**Cross-Platform Promotion is Key**: A standout observation—many thriving educators strategically utilize multiple social media platforms in their initial journey. Frequent posts on YouTube, coupled with a few Udemy course releases, create a dynamic presence. Cross platform promotion is commonly observed and highly recommended.
2.	**Transitioning Efforts Smartly:** Did you notice the concentration of records along one axis but almost never along a slope? Most successful individuals gradually channel their efforts onto one primary platform while keeping a secondary one active. The recommendation for JD? Follow the trend, pick a primary platform after gaining traction, but maintain presence across others. The graph also implies that success on one platform doesn't guarantee success on another—each requires its unique effort.
3.	**Diversify Your Income Stream**: Just as industry influencers create product lines, online educators are advised to explore supplementary products for other platforms. Imagine leveraging YouTube success to make it the primary hub while using Udemy courses as a secondary income source. Selling enhanced versions of YouTube content on Udemy could unlock new revenue streams.

Finally, a nod to the foundation of our insights—the data. Social media success, as we all know, isn't just a win; it's a gold rush. Our data mirrors this phenomenon, showcasing non-Gaussian distributions and exponential variables. A testament to the unique dynamics of the online teaching landscape.
